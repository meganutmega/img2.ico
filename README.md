# img2.ico
 This is a batch file that converts images into multiple-res .ICO files. Made possible with ***ImageMagick*** by ImageMagick Studio LLC.
 
# Disclaimer
 **This currently only works with windows!!!**
 
 You will need ImageMagick installed to convert your files. You can download it [here.](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
 
 This is my first batch file, let alone utility program. I have been informed that the code can be optimized and there are plans for it in the future as well as a GUI. There are plenty of things to do and lots of progress to be made.

## How to use
 1. Run `img2ico.bat` in the img2.ico folder.
 2. Specify a folder of .PNG files to convert to .ICO.
 3. Wait for images to convert.
 4. An "Icons" folder will be added to the image folder with your .ico files.
